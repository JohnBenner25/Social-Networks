In Personal Networks, the class was designed around creating a survey for W&L students that would allow us to create egocentric social networks for the students we surveyed in an unbiased manner. Using that data, we then created research questions and conducted statistical analysis on it. My question was on the impact of athletic homophily in one’s network on feelings of belonging. Athletic homophily was determined by whether people in one’s network were on the same athletic teams as the ego, with the theory that individuals with high levels of athletic homophily in their network would on average exhibit higher feelings of belonging. Unfortunately, our sample was rather small, which limited statistical power, but ultimately the results disproved my theory, which presents the theory that individuals with more diverse networks exhibit higher levels of belonging than those with smaller social groups.
